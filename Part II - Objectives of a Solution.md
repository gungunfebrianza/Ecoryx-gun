Disclosure conversion driven by AI



## **Task: ESG Framework Mapping Feature**

### Goal

Build a feature using Node.js (backend) and React (frontend) that allows a user to reuse ESG disclosures across different frameworks using AI.

### Example Scenario

A user has already created an ESG disclosure using GRI and wants to create another disclosure using SASB. The system should:

- Allow the user to reference the existing GRI disclosure
- Automatically map and pre-fill similar data into SASB fields
- Handle data conversions where needed (for example: total values to percentages)
- Handle text/commentary/narrative sections by converting and reusing qualitative disclosures from GRI into relevant SASB narrative requirements (text-based mapping, similar to data conversion)
