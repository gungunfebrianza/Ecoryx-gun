# Management of Scope 1 Emissions: Strategy, Targets, and Performance

X Company manages Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through an integrated short- and long-term strategy focused on operational efficiency, methane management, and low-emission technologies. In 2025, gross direct (Scope 1) emissions totaled 5,200,000 metric tonnes CO₂-e, down from a 2020 base year of 6,000,000 metric tonnes CO₂-e, representing a 13.3% reduction [(6,000,000 − 5,200,000) ÷ 6,000,000 × 100]. This reduction was primarily driven by flare minimization, methane leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs, and electrification of key processes. Biogenic CO₂ emissions were 150,000 metric tonnes CO₂-e, reflecting the use of biomass in remote operations as a partial substitute for fossil fuels.

The company has established short-term Scope 1 reduction targets as part of its emissions management strategy. A key near-term objective is a 10% reduction in Scope 1 emissions by 2027, with a focus on leak detection, flare optimization, and operational best practices across onshore North American and Middle Eastern assets. This short-term target is supported by investments in advanced LDAR technologies, improved combustion efficiency in engines and flares, and incremental equipment electrification, as well as process optimization to limit routine venting and fugitive emissions.

Over the long term, X Company is committed to achieving net-zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. This long-term strategy includes progressive decarbonization of operations through electrification with lower-carbon power, deployment of low-emission technologies, and integration of renewable energy and emerging decarbonization solutions where feasible. The company complements these efforts with systematic emissions monitoring using the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, application of IPCC and API methodologies, and third-party verification where applicable to ensure robustness and transparency.

Performance against these targets is monitored through both absolute emissions and emissions intensity. Between the 2020 base year and 2025, Scope 1 emissions intensity improved to 45 tonnes CO₂-e per thousand barrels of oil equivalent (boe), in parallel with a 20% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions relative to 2020, achieved through flare minimization, methane detection and repair, and electrification initiatives. These results indicate that the company is progressing toward its short-term reduction objectives while building the operational and technology foundation needed to advance toward its 2050 net-zero ambition.

To support delivery of its emissions strategy, X Company allocates dedicated capital to low-emission technologies and related environmental initiatives. In 2025, the company invested $50 million in low-emission technologies explicitly supporting Scope 1 and 2 reduction, and more than $115 million cumulatively in low-emission technologies, water infrastructure, biodiversity restoration, and community and human rights programs. Stakeholders are engaged through annual sustainability forums and regular disclosures aligned with GRI and SASB frameworks, enabling ongoing dialogue on progress, challenges, and future plans for Scope 1 emissions management and decarbonization.

# Air Emissions of NOₓ, SOₓ, VOCs, and PM₁₀ (EM-EP-120a.1)

Significant air emissions for the fiscal year 2025 were quantified and reported in metric tonnes (t) for key pollutants. Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ, excluding N₂O) emissions totaled 12,000 t, primarily from combustion in engines and flares. Sulfur oxides (SOₓ) emissions were 8,500 t, driven mainly by sour gas processing activities. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions were 15,000 t, largely associated with venting and fugitive sources. Particulate matter emissions, reported as PM₁₀ from dust and combustion sources, totaled 3,500 t.

EM-EP-140a.1 - Water Management

# Water Management Performance (SASB EM-EP-140a.1)

Total water withdrawn in 2025 was 3,200 thousand cubic metres (m³). Withdrawal in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress, as defined using the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, was 800 thousand m³. The percentage of total water withdrawn in high or extremely high water-stress regions was therefore 25% (800 ÷ 3,200 × 100).

Total water consumed in 2025 is **[Data not available] - Metric not tracked during reporting period**. Accordingly, the percentage of total water consumed in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress is **[Data not available] - Metric not tracked during reporting period**.

Water withdrawal in high and extremely high water-stress regions represented 25% of total withdrawals and 25% of total withdrawals and consumption combined, reflecting the concentration of operations in arid and water-constrained basins such as parts of the Permian Basin and the Middle East.

EM-EP-140a.2 - Water Management

# Produced Water and Flowback Management

In 2025, produced water and flowback generated totaled 2,000 thousand m³. Of this volume, 5% was discharged, 60% was injected, and 35% was recycled. This corresponds to 100 thousand m³ discharged, 1,200 thousand m³ injected, and 700 thousand m³ recycled. The percentage allocations are calculated as: discharged = (100 / 2,000) × 100 = 5%; injected = (1,200 / 2,000) × 100 = 60%; recycled = (700 / 2,000) × 100 = 35%.

All produced water and flowback discharges were treated prior to release and met or exceeded applicable water quality standards. Discharged produced water and flowback contained an average hydrocarbon concentration of 10 mg/L. Based on monitoring and mass balance, the total hydrocarbon content in discharged produced water and flowback was 10 metric tonnes for the reporting year. No untreated produced water or flowback was discharged during the period.

**[Data not available]** - Metric not tracked during reporting period.

Water quality around hydraulic fracturing sites is managed through site-specific plans within the Environmental Management System, including baseline and ongoing monitoring of parameters such as pH, salinity, total dissolved solids, and hydrocarbons to detect any potential deterioration in ground or surface water quality. However, while monitoring programs and impact assessments are in place, the percentage of hydraulic fracturing sites where ground or surface water quality deteriorated compared to a baseline has not yet been quantified and reported as a percentage (%).

EM-EP-160a.1 - Biodiversity Impacts

# Environmental Management Policies and Practices for Active Sites – Biodiversity

X Company integrates biodiversity considerations into environmental management across all active operated sites through a structured, risk-based approach. All new projects are required to develop Integrated Biodiversity Management Plans (IBMPs) that incorporate pre-development baseline surveys, biodiversity impact modeling, and ongoing monitoring. Site assessments leverage tools such as the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), and site-specific biodiversity baseline studies to identify proximity to protected areas, Key Biodiversity Areas, and habitats for threatened species. In 2025, 120 active operational sites (production facilities, well pads, pipelines) were screened, with 18 sites (15%) located within 5 km of protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value, triggering enhanced assessment and controls.

The environmental management framework for biodiversity is anchored in the mitigation hierarchy: avoid, minimize, restore, and offset. Avoidance measures include no-go zones in high-sensitivity areas and rerouting of planned infrastructure such as roads and pipelines to reduce habitat fragmentation. Where impacts cannot be fully avoided, operational controls focus on minimization, such as seasonal restrictions on activities in sensitive habitats, mandatory spill prevention measures (including secondary containment and pipeline integrity programs), and maintenance of wildlife corridors in onshore areas. Restoration commitments include systematic post-drilling reclamation and habitat rehabilitation; in 2025, this included 1,200 acres of restored land and the designation of 300 acres as protected buffers around sensitive sites, with all restored areas monitored for at least five years and success measured using criteria such as >80% native vegetation cover and evidence of wildlife presence.

Biodiversity risk management explicitly addresses species of conservation concern and critical habitats. Operations overlap habitats of 12 IUCN Red List species, including endangered desert tortoise in U.S. operations and vulnerable migratory birds in Middle East assets. No critical habitat impacts were identified in 2025, and potential impacts are managed through targeted mitigation such as timing restrictions on construction and maintenance, light and noise reduction measures, and habitat-sensitive routing. Where residual impacts remain after avoidance, minimization, and restoration, biodiversity offsets are implemented, including habitat banking and restoration projects delivered in partnership with conservation NGOs.

Governance of biodiversity and broader environmental performance is overseen by the ESG Committee of the Board, which reviews biodiversity-related risks, opportunities, and incidents at least quarterly. Annual biodiversity risk assessments are conducted across operated assets, and the company has set a target of achieving zero net loss of biodiversity by 2035, aligned with emerging frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and relevant industry guidance. In 2025, X Company invested $25 million in biodiversity initiatives, including habitat mapping, restoration projects, and the development of improved monitoring systems, and recorded no material fines or non-compliance events related to biodiversity.

EM-EP-160a.2 - Biodiversity Impacts

# Hydrocarbon Spills

In 2025, there were 3 hydrocarbon spills classified as minor incidents. The aggregate volume of hydrocarbon spills totaled 15 barrels (bbls). No spills occurred in Arctic regions, consistent with the absence of Arctic operations during the reporting year, resulting in 0 bbls released in the Arctic. No significant spills impacted sensitive habitats, and no spill volumes affected shorelines with Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) rankings 8–10, resulting in 0 bbls impacting such shorelines.

Spill response effectiveness remained high, with 80% of the total spilled volume recovered. Based on total spill volume of 15 bbls, the volume recovered was 12 bbls (15 bbls × 0.80), leaving 3 bbls unrecovered. There were no reportable hydrocarbon spills associated with marine terminals or offshore facilities, and all incidents were contained on-site within secondary containment or soil immediately adjacent to operational equipment.

EM-EP-160a.3 - Biodiversity Impacts

# Percentage of Proved and Probable Reserves Near Protected or High-Biodiversity Areas (EM-EP-160a.3)

Low reserve exposure to protected and high-biodiversity areas was maintained in the reporting year, with an estimated 8–12% of total reserves located in or near sites with protected conservation status or endangered species habitat. For SASB reporting purposes, the midpoint of this range is applied. Accordingly, approximately 10% of proved reserves and 10% of probable reserves are considered to be in or near protected areas or endangered species habitat.

All active sites were screened against recognized conservation databases (including IUCN categories I–VI, Ramsar sites, Key Biodiversity Areas, and habitats for IUCN Red List species), and 15% of operational sites were identified as being within 5 km of protected areas or other high biodiversity value areas. These site-level assessments inform the calculation of reserve exposure percentages and are integrated into project planning and ongoing field development to avoid or minimize biodiversity impacts.

No reserves are located in Arctic regions, and high-sensitivity “no-go” zones are excluded from reserve booking. Where reserves are near habitats of endangered or vulnerable species, development plans are governed by Integrated Biodiversity Management Plans (IBMPs) and the mitigation hierarchy, and are aligned with the company’s zero net biodiversity loss target by 2035.

EM-EP-210a.1 - Security, Human Rights & Rights of Indigenous Peoples

# Proved and Probable Reserves in or Near Areas of Conflict

X Company operates in politically stable regions and avoids high‑risk conflict zones. As a result, 0% of proved reserves and 0% of probable reserves are located in or near areas of conflict, as defined by our enterprise-wide human rights and conflict risk assessments.

Operations in the Middle East are limited to onshore conventional fields in jurisdictions assessed as politically stable; enhanced due diligence, third‑party conflict risk monitoring, and contingency planning are applied where geopolitical tensions exist to confirm that no proved or probable reserves fall within areas classified as conflict zones.

EM-EP-210a.2 - Security, Human Rights & Rights of Indigenous Peoples

# Percentage of Proved and Probable Reserves in or Near Indigenous Land

Operations near indigenous lands represent an estimated 5–7% of total reserves. For reporting purposes, the midpoint of this range, 6%, is used as a reasonable estimate, with the recognition that this figure reflects both proved and probable reserves combined in or near indigenous territories. This percentage is based on reserves subject to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) processes and enhanced community engagement protocols.

The percentage of proved reserves in or near indigenous land is estimated at 6.0% of total proved reserves, assuming the distribution of reserves near indigenous lands is proportional across the total reserves portfolio. This assumption is applied consistently across reserve categories in the absence of more granular segmentation.

The percentage of probable reserves in or near indigenous land is likewise estimated at 6.0% of total probable reserves, under the same proportionality assumption used for proved reserves. **[Data not available]** - More detailed disaggregation of the 5–7% figure between proved and probable reserve categories is not tracked during the reporting period.

EM-EP-210a.3 - Security, Human Rights & Rights of Indigenous Peoples

# Security, Human Rights, and Rights of Indigenous Peoples

X Company recognizes human rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples, as core to responsible operations, particularly where activities involve land access, community interactions, and security arrangements. Our Human Rights Policy is aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR), and commits the company to respect internationally recognized human rights, conduct due diligence, and remediate adverse impacts. In 2025, annual enterprise-wide human rights risk assessments were conducted to identify high-risk operations, and site-specific Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) covered 100% of new drilling sites.

Security practices are governed by GRI 410-aligned management approaches and the VPSHR. All security personnel, including company employees and third-party contractors, receive mandatory training on human rights policies, de-escalation techniques, and prohibitions on excessive force; in 2025, 100% of security personnel completed at least 8 hours of human rights training. Security risk assessments are conducted for all sites, with explicit screening for human rights risks, such as the potential for conflict with local communities. Security contractors are screened for human rights compliance during procurement, and contracts include binding clauses requiring adherence to the company’s Human Rights Policy. No incidents of security-related human rights violations were reported in 2025, and no material fines, legal actions, or reputational incidents related to security and human rights occurred.

Respect for the rights of indigenous peoples is integrated into project planning and ongoing operations, in line with GRI 411 and IFC Performance Standard 7. Operations near indigenous lands—representing approximately 5–7% of reserves—are subject to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) processes consistent with national laws (such as U.S. tribal consultation requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act). We maintain ongoing dialogue through community liaison officers, joint monitoring committees, and culturally appropriate engagement mechanisms. Employees receive cultural sensitivity training, and we support indigenous-led initiatives, including education and economic development funds. In 2025, there were no incidents of violations involving the rights of indigenous peoples, including no reported cases of forced displacement, lack of FPIC, or cultural heritage damage, and no such incidents have been reported in the past five years.

Engagement processes with communities, including indigenous communities where relevant, follow a structured framework: identify stakeholders; assess interests and potential impacts; engage through formal and informal channels such as town halls and dedicated community meetings; and monitor and report outcomes. Grievance mechanisms are available 24/7, are accessible, culturally appropriate, and offer anonymous submission where requested. In 2025, 95% of community grievances were resolved within 60 days. The company allocated $15 million in 2025 to community and human rights programs, including indigenous partnerships and enhancements to security and human rights training.

Operations are primarily located in politically stable onshore regions in the United States (Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale) and select conventional onshore fields in the Middle East. The company avoids high-risk conflict zones; where geopolitical tensions exist, particularly in certain Middle East border areas, enhanced due diligence is implemented, including third-party conflict risk monitoring, contingency planning, and reinforced security and community engagement protocols. The ESG Committee of the Board oversees performance on human rights, indigenous rights, and operations in areas of conflict, with an explicit goal of zero human rights violations and full FPIC compliance by 2030.

EM-EP-210b.1 - Community Relations

# Community Rights and Interests

X Company recognizes the rights and interests of local and Indigenous communities as a core element of responsible exploration and production activities, particularly where operations involve land access, community interactions, and security arrangements. Human rights management is guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, with oversight by the ESG Committee and integration into enterprise-wide risk management and site-level practices.

Human rights due diligence is conducted through annual enterprise-wide risk assessments to identify high-risk operations and mandatory site-specific Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) for all new projects or expansions; in 2025, HRIAs covered 100% of new drilling sites. Third-party human rights impact assessments are conducted on a biennial basis for all operated assets under an operational control approach. Where operations are near Indigenous lands, primarily in the United States, X Company implements free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) processes aligned with IFC Performance Standard 7 and applicable national laws, maintains ongoing dialogue via community liaison officers and joint monitoring committees, and provides cultural sensitivity training to employees. In 2025, no incidents of violations involving the rights of Indigenous peoples were recorded, including no cases of forced displacement, lack of FPIC, or cultural heritage damage.

Security-related community risks are managed through policies, training, and contractor oversight designed to prevent adverse human rights impacts on communities. All security personnel, including third-party contractors, receive mandatory training on human rights policies, the Voluntary Principles, de-escalation techniques, and prohibitions on excessive force; in 2025, 100% of security personnel completed at least 8 hours of human rights training. Security risk assessments are conducted for all sites, explicitly screening for potential conflict with communities, and security contractors are screened for human rights compliance with contractual requirements to adhere to the Human Rights Policy. In 2025, no security-related human rights violations were reported.

Structured stakeholder engagement processes are used to identify and manage community-related risks and opportunities across operating regions, including politically stable onshore areas of the United States and selected Middle East fields where competition for land and water resources can create community sensitivities. Engagement follows a defined cycle—identify stakeholders, assess interests and impacts, engage through formal and informal channels such as town halls and dedicated forums, and monitor and report outcomes. Grievance mechanisms are accessible 24/7, culturally appropriate, and allow anonymous submissions where requested; in 2025, 95% of community grievances were resolved within 60 days. Water management in high-stress and arid regions is addressed as a shared-resource issue through annual water forums, community partnerships, and beneficial reuse pilots to mitigate potential conflicts, and no significant water-related community conflicts were reported in 2025.

Governance structures and resource commitments reinforce the management of community rights and interests. The ESG Committee oversees human rights and community performance, with targets of zero human rights violations and full FPIC compliance by 2030. In 2025, X Company allocated $15 million to community and human rights programs, including Indigenous partnerships and security training enhancements, and $25 million to biodiversity initiatives such as habitat mapping and restoration in areas overlapping community and ecological interests. No material fines, legal actions, or reputational incidents related to community rights, Indigenous rights, security practices, or biodiversity impacts occurred during the reporting period.

EM-EP-320a.2 - Workforce Health & Safety

# Management of Safety Culture Across the Exploration and Production Lifecycle

Safety is embedded as a core value throughout X Company’s exploration and production lifecycle, supported by a formal Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) management system aligned with recognized industry practices. Governance of workforce health and safety is overseen by the Board-level ESG Committee and an executive HSE leadership team, which establish policies, approve strategic priorities, and review performance on a quarterly basis. Site-level management implements these policies through standardized procedures covering exploration, drilling and completions, production operations, maintenance, and decommissioning, with clear accountability for safety performance at each operational layer.

The HSE management system integrates systematic risk identification, assessment, and control across all operated assets in North America and the Middle East. Operational risk management includes structured hazard identification and job safety analyses, process safety reviews for facilities, and barrier management for high-risk activities such as well interventions and sour-gas handling. Engineering and administrative controls are prioritized over personal protective equipment, and operating procedures are updated in response to incident learnings, regulatory developments, and technological changes. Emergency preparedness is addressed through site-specific response plans, drills, and coordination with local authorities and community stakeholders.

To reinforce a culture of safety, X Company promotes workforce engagement, training, and shared responsibility for safe operations. All personnel, including contractors, receive role-specific HSE training and are empowered to exercise stop-work authority when unsafe conditions are observed. Safety expectations and performance are communicated regularly through leadership engagements, toolbox talks, and safety campaigns. A low Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) was maintained in 2025, reflecting ongoing emphasis on prevention, safe work practices, and contractor management.

Continuous improvement is driven by a structured incident and near-miss reporting, investigation, and learning process. All recordable incidents and significant near misses are systematically investigated to identify root causes and corrective actions, which are tracked to closure and shared across the organization. Performance metrics—including TRIR, lost-time incident rates, process safety indicators, and leading indicators such as hazard observations and corrective action closure rates—are used to monitor trends and prioritize interventions. Lessons learned are integrated into updated standards, procedures, and training materials, reinforcing a feedback loop that strengthens safety culture over time.

Human rights and community considerations are integrated into safety management where operations intersect with local and indigenous communities. X Company applies Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for activities near indigenous lands and maintains grievance mechanisms with a 95% issue-resolution rate within 60 days. Security practices are aligned with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, with 100% of security personnel trained, helping ensure that the protection of people and assets is conducted in a manner that respects human rights while safeguarding the health and safety of workers and neighboring communities.

EM-EP-420a.4 - Reserves Valuation & Capital Expenditures

# Influence of Hydrocarbon Markets and Climate Regulation on Capital Expenditure Strategy

Capital expenditure strategy for exploration, acquisition, and development of assets is directly shaped by the evolving price and demand outlook for hydrocarbons, alongside increasingly stringent climate regulations. As a mid-sized independent oil and gas producer with approximately 115 million boe of annual production in 2025, X Company prioritizes investments that remain resilient under a range of commodity price and carbon cost scenarios, including those aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and a long-term transition toward net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050.

Short- to medium-term capital allocation emphasizes projects that improve emissions performance and reduce regulatory and price risk, including flare minimization, methane leak detection, and electrification of operations. These initiatives contributed to a 20% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions from the 2020 base year, with 2025 Scope 1 emissions at 5.2 million t CO₂-e and Scope 2 emissions in the 0.75–0.80 million t CO₂-e range. Capital programs are screened for their impact on emissions intensity (45 t CO₂-e per thousand boe in 2025) and potential exposure to future carbon pricing, permitting constraints, and air-quality standards, using methodologies aligned with the GHG Protocol and regional regulatory frameworks.

Climate and environmental regulation, particularly around air emissions and water, informs both project selection and the timing of development. In regions subject to tighter air emissions controls, capital expenditures prioritize low-emission combustion technologies, sour gas processing improvements (to manage NOx and SOx), and infrastructure that reduces venting and fugitives, supporting compliance and lowering potential liabilities. In water-stressed areas, capital allocation favors water infrastructure and recycling capacity, including the 2025 investment of $40 million in water technologies to expand produced water recycling, thereby reducing reliance on fresh water and mitigating exposure to potential future restrictions and cost increases on withdrawals and discharges.

Over the long term, the capital program increasingly supports transition-aligned technologies and assets that enhance resilience in lower-hydrocarbon-demand scenarios. More than $115 million has been directed toward low-emission technologies, water infrastructure, biodiversity restoration, and community and human rights programs, reflecting a capital strategy that integrates climate and social factors alongside hydrocarbon price signals. Portfolio decisions give preference to assets with competitive breakeven costs, lower emissions intensity, and limited exposure to protected areas or high-conflict zones, helping to preserve optionality as policy, technology, and demand trends evolve.

The overall approach is to maintain flexibility in exploration and development plans, pacing investments in response to commodity price signals while embedding climate regulation and transition risk into capital budgeting and project sanctioning criteria. This includes ongoing reassessment of reserves development plans under different climate policy scenarios, prioritization of projects that can deliver lower life-cycle emissions per boe, and targeted investments that support the company’s stated net-zero and environmental targets without compromising long-term value creation.

The company supports robust, predictable regulatory frameworks that align with international standards such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and relevant environmental conventions, while also enabling energy security and just transition objectives. Regulatory compliance is embedded within the Environmental Management System (EMS) and human rights governance framework, and is overseen by the ESG Committee, which reviews performance and incidents on at least a quarterly basis.

On environmental policy, X Company aligns its positions with emerging expectations on biodiversity and nature-related risks, including alignment with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and industry guidance. The company’s policy stance supports regulatory measures that protect critical habitats and high-sensitivity areas, encourage the use of integrated biodiversity management plans, and promote application of the mitigation hierarchy, including biodiversity offsets where residual impacts occur. Internally, these expectations are operationalized through Integrated Biodiversity Management Plans for all new projects, designation of no-go zones in high-sensitivity areas, and investment in biodiversity initiatives and habitat restoration. In 2025, $25 million was invested in biodiversity-related initiatives, reflecting support for regulatory and voluntary mechanisms that advance zero net loss of biodiversity by 2035.

On water policy and regulation, X Company supports risk-based regulatory approaches that recognize water as a shared resource, particularly in arid and high-stress regions. The company’s position favors regulations that incentivize efficient use, recycling and beneficial reuse of produced water, and stringent discharge standards to protect surface and groundwater quality. Operational practices are designed to comply with and, where feasible, exceed local regulatory requirements, including U.S. EPA NPDES standards for onshore operations and MARPOL requirements for offshore discharges. Minimum internal standards for discharges include total dissolved solids (TDS) below 500 mg/L and hydrocarbon content below 15 mg/L, with quarterly testing and treatment processes such as separation, filtration, and biological treatment to manage regulatory and environmental risks.

On social and human rights–related regulation, X Company publicly recognizes human rights, including the rights of Indigenous Peoples, as a core element of responsible operations and supports regulatory and policy frameworks that reflect the UNGPs and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. The company’s position endorses requirements for Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) for activities on or affecting Indigenous lands, culturally appropriate engagement processes, and robust grievance mechanisms. Internal practices include cultural sensitivity training for employees, seeking FPIC, and maintaining 24/7 accessible grievance channels designed to be anonymous where requested. The company also supports regulatory expectations around security provider conduct and due diligence, especially in areas with geopolitical tensions, and implements enhanced conflict-risk monitoring and contingency planning in such locations.

X Company participates in industry initiatives, such as Ipieca biodiversity working groups and the Ipieca Human Rights Task Force, to inform its policy positions and contribute to the development of industry guidance that can support future regulatory frameworks. Through these channels, the company advocates for harmonized, science-based environmental standards, clear expectations on corporate human rights due diligence, and disclosure practices that enhance transparency without compromising security or commercial sensitivities. The ESG Committee provides governance over these regulatory engagement activities and associated targets, including zero net loss of biodiversity by 2035 and zero human rights violations with full FPIC compliance by 2030.

EM-EP-540a.1 - Critical Incident Risk Management

# Process Safety Events (Tier 1 LOPC) – Rates

Process safety performance is monitored using internationally recognized Tier 1 Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) criteria; however, Tier 1 PSE data were not systematically tracked in a manner that allows calculation of a rate for the reporting period. **[Data not available] - Metric not tracked during reporting period**

To enhance alignment with SASB EM-EP-540a.1 requirements, the company is implementing standardized process safety event recording and classification across all operated assets, including consistent logging of Tier 1 LOPC events and associated exposure hours. This will enable calculation and disclosure of a Tier 1 PSE rate (events per 200,000 work hours) in future reporting cycles.

EM-EP-540a.2 - Critical Incident Risk Management

# Critical Incident Risk Management

Catastrophic and tail-end risks are managed through an integrated risk framework embedded in the company’s Human Rights Policy, Environmental Management System (EMS), and site-level emergency preparedness and response plans. Annual enterprise-wide risk assessments identify high-risk operations, with site-specific Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) required for all new projects and expansions; in 2025, HRIAs covered 100% of new drilling sites. These processes evaluate potential for severe, low-likelihood events, including large-scale spills, major process safety failures, community conflicts, and security-related incidents, and inform mitigation measures such as engineering controls, operational procedures, and community engagement plans.

Security-related catastrophic risks are addressed through alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and implementation of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR). All security personnel, including contractors, receive mandatory annual human rights training that covers VPSHR, de-escalation techniques, and prohibitions on excessive use of force; in 2025, 100% of security personnel completed at least 8 hours of this training. Security risk assessments are conducted for all sites, screening for human rights and conflict risks with local communities, and security contractors are screened for human rights compliance and bound by contractual clauses requiring adherence to the Human Rights Policy. No incidents of security-related human rights violations were reported in 2025.

Catastrophic social and cultural risks, including those affecting indigenous peoples, are managed through structured engagement and consent processes. Where operations are near indigenous lands, the company implements free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) processes aligned with IFC Performance Standard 7 and applicable national laws, including U.S. tribal consultation requirements under the National Historic Preservation Act. Ongoing dialogue is maintained through community liaison officers and joint monitoring committees, which provide early identification and resolution of potential tail-end risks such as land access disputes, cultural heritage impacts, and project-related resettlement. There were no incidents of violations involving the rights of indigenous peoples in 2025 or in the preceding five years.

Environmental catastrophic and tail-end risks, including large spills and irreversible biodiversity impacts, are addressed through Integrated Biodiversity Management Plans (IBMPs) for all new projects, application of the mitigation hierarchy, and establishment of no-go zones in high-sensitivity areas. IBMPs incorporate baseline ecological surveys, impact modeling, and ongoing monitoring to identify low-probability, high-consequence outcomes, with biodiversity offsets implemented where residual impacts cannot be avoided. Targets such as zero net loss of biodiversity by 2035 and annual biodiversity risk assessments are overseen by the ESG Committee, which reviews reported incidents quarterly and ensures that lessons learned are incorporated into management systems and project approvals.

Water-related catastrophic risks, particularly in high-stress and arid regions, are managed through site-specific water management plans integrated into the EMS. These plans assess risks related to scarcity, quality, and regulatory compliance, prioritize the use of non-freshwater sources such as recycled produced water in high-stress areas, and support investments in storage, treatment, and beneficial reuse infrastructure. Engagement with local stakeholders, including annual water forums and partnerships with other operators, is used to identify emerging tail-end risks related to competition for water resources with agriculture and municipal users. No significant water-related conflicts were reported in 2025.
