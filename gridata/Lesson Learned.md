# Lesson Learned

**1-to-Many Mapping**

One SASB metric often maps to several GRI disclosures and vice-versa. The relationship is not clean 1:1.

**Different Philosophies**

- **SASB:** **Financial materiality** (What affects enterprise value?). Metrics are often quantitative, specific, and industry-tailored (e.g., % of reserves in conflict zones, PSE rates).

- **GRI:** **Impact materiality** (What are the organization's impacts on the economy, environment, and people?). It's more principle-based and global.

**Gaps:** Some SASB metrics (especially in Reserves Valuation - EM-EP-420a) have **no direct GRI equivalent** because they address investor-focused transition risks.
